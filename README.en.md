7. MQTT Integration ‚Äì Topics, Payloads, and Examples  
The gateway uses MQTT for bidirectional communication: control, status messages, statistics, and error reports. The MQTT functionality is completely optional and can be disabled through configuration.  
7.1. Topic Overview  
Topic	Type	Description  
modbus/status	LWT	Connection status of the gateway (online / offline)  
modbus/stats	Status	Statistics as JSON (optionally cyclic)  
modbus/log	Log	Log messages from the gateway

modbus/write/<type>/<address>	Command	Write access to ad:  
[1, 2, 3, 4]  
Response (e.g. in modbus/response/coil)  
{  
"1": 1,  
"2": 0,  
"3": 1,  
"4": 1  
}  
7.6. Request Statistics  
Topic:  
modbus/command/stats  
Payload: (arbitrary or empty)  
Response (immediate status message to modbus/stats):  
{  
"tcp_requests": 234,  
"rtu_success": 231,  
"rtu_failures": 3,  
"dropped": 0,  
"echo_replies": 7  
}  
7.7. Logging  
Topic:  
modbus/log  
Example Payload:  
[2025-06-26 19:33:00] ‚Üí RTU TX: 01 03 00 00 00 02 65 CB  
Activation via:  
[log]  
hex_dump = 1  
8. Modbus TCP ‚Üî RTU ‚Äì Protocol Flow and Implementation  
The gateway acts as a protocol translator: it receives Modbus TCP requests from clients, converts them to Modbus RTU, forwards them via RS485, and responds with correctly constructed Modbus TCP packets.  
8.1. Process of a TCP Request  
TCP request received  

    The gateway listens on the configured port (Default: 502).  

    modbus_receive() extracts MBAP header and PDU.  

Analyze MBAP header  

    Transaction ID, receive
0x0000 Loopback test (Echo) Response generated locally
0x000A Reset statistics counter Set counter to 0
0x000B Return TCP request counter Response generated locally
0x000C Return error counter Response generated locally
other Not recognized Request forwarded to RTU
8.3 Hex Debug Log
The function dump_hex() generates a log in hexadecimal form:
dump_hex("‚Üí RTU TX: ", data, len);
Example output (in modbus/log):
‚Üí RTU TX: 01 03 00 00 00 02 65 CB
‚Üê RTU RX: 01 03 04 00 0A 00 0B 75 D3
8.4 Connection Parameters
Configurable in the INI file:
[serial]
port = /dev/ttyAMA0
baudrate = 9600
parity = N
databits = 8
stopbits = 1
[modbus]
slave_id = 1
8.5 RTU Timing Behavior
modbus_set_response_timeout(ctx, 1, 0);  // 1 second timeout
Reliable response times heavily depend on the RTU slave. Typical roundtrip times: 5‚ÄØ‚Äì‚ÄØ50‚ÄØms.
9. System Integration: systemd, Autostart & Logging

SRC = modbus_gateway.cpp ini.c  
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -O2 -std=c++17 -I/usr/local/include  
LDFLAGS = -L/usr/local/lib -lmodbus -lpaho-mqttpp3 -lpaho-mqtt3as -lpthread  
.PHONY: all clean _gateway.ini.example  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md  
10.4. Release Archive (optional)  
Creating an archive:  
tar czf modbus_gateway.tar.gz modbus_gateway/  
Deploying on GitHub or copying locally via scp to the target Raspberry Pi:  
scp modbus_gateway.tar.gz pi@raspberrypi:/home/pi/  
11. Examples of MQTT and Modbus TCP Integration  
This chapter presents practical examples of using the gateway with MQTT and Modbus TCP. The target audience is integrators who use the gateway, e.g., with Node-RED, Home Assistant, or their own automations.  
11.1. MQTT Examples  
üì• Writing a Holding Register  
mosquitto_pub -t modbus/write/100 -m 42  
‚û°Ô∏è Sets Modbus Holding Register 100 to the value 42.  
üì§ Reading a Holding Register  
mosquitto_pub -t modbus/read/100 -n  
üì¨ The gateway responds with:  
Topic: modbus/read/100  
Payload: 42  
üì• Writing a Coil (Switch Command)  
mosquitto_pub -t modbus/write_coil/12 -m 1  
‚û°Ô∏è Turns Coil 12 ON.  
üì§ Reading a Coil  
mosquitto_pub -t se 100

-c 2: 2 Read register

127.0.0.1: Gateway address  
Response (if successful):  
[1]: 42  
[2]: 81  
11.3. Node-RED Integration (Example)  
Subscribe Node:  
Topic: modbus/read/100  

Receives: Register value  
Inject Node:  
Topic: modbus/write/100  

Payload: 123  
‚û°Ô∏è This allows Node-RED to set and read Modbus values ‚Äì ideal for automation.  
12. Error handling and debugging  
This section describes how errors in the gateway can be detected, logged, and ideally resolved. It helps both developers and integrators to analyze problems more quickly.  
12.1. Overview of Error Sources  
Error source     Typical cause            Suggested solution  
Modbus RTU Timeout  No device responds to the request  Check baud rate, parity, slave ID  
MQTT Error         Broker unreachable or certificate error   Check MQTT configuration  
TCP Error          TCP client disconnects the connection     Normal at connection end, log if necessary  
INI Error          Syntax error or path not present   Check path & format set to 0  
0x000B Return number of TCP requests 2-byte response with current count  
0x000C Return number of errors 2-byte response with error count  
These are ideal for external monitoring software.  
12.5. MQTT Statistics and Diagnostic Data  
All counter values are included in the topic modbus/stats, e.g.:  
{  
"total_tcp_requests": 156,  
"total_rtu_requests": 154,  
"total_errors": 2,  
"rtu_success": 154,  
"rtu_failures": 0,  
"dropped": 0,  
"echo_replies": 1,  
"last_success_timestamp": 1719414809  
}  
Allows for graphical evaluations (e.g., in Grafana or Node-RED Dashboard).  
12.6. Increased Fault Tolerance  
The gateway does not immediately drop TCP connections on every error, but allows for, e.g.:  
multiple faulty RTU communications in succession  

empty received TCP packets ‚Üí are ignored  

connection drops ‚Üí clean cleanup in shutdown_gateway()  
13. Deployment and System Integration  
This chapter describes how the Modbus gateway is deployed on a target system. StandardError=journal

Response:  
modbus/response/holding/3/0  
Payload:  
[1234]  
Example 4: Read Input Register 30010 to 30014 from Slave 2  
Topic (Request):

Response:  
modbus/response/input/2/9  
Payload:  
[318, 319, 320, 321, 322]  
15.3. Receive diagnostic data via MQTT  
If mqttStatsInterval > 0 is set in the INI file, the gateway sends statistics periodically:  
Topic:  
modbus/stats  
Payload:  
{  
"tcp_requests": 123,  
"rtu_success": 120,  
"rtu_failures": 3,  
"dropped": 0,  
"echo_replies": 5  
}  
15.4. Manually request statistics via command  
Topic:  
modbus/command/stats  
Payload: (optional, e.g., "now")  
Response will again be on modbus/stats.  
16. Examples for Modbus TCP communication  
This chapter shows how an external Modbus TCP client can connect to the gateway to access the underlying RTU devices via the TCP interface. The gateway acts as a proxy. 1. 
16.4. Additional Clients
Other clients such as:
QModMaster (Windows/Qt)

Node-RED with Modbus Nodes

Python (pymodbus)

CODESYS or TIA Portal 
can work directly with the gateway without special adjustments, as long as they support Modbus TCP. 
17. Logging and Diagnostics
17.1. File Logging
All events, errors, status changes are logged to the file:
 /var/log/modbus_gateway.log
Configurable via:
[log]
file = /var/log/modbus_gateway.log
17.2. MQTT Logging
Each log line is additionally published on the topic:
modbus/log 
provided that MQTT is connected. 
17.3. Enable Hex Dump
For analyzing RTU communication, a hex dump can be enabled:
[log]
hex_dump = 1
Example output:
‚Üí RTU TX: 01 03 00 6B 00 03 76 87
‚Üê RTU RX: 01 03 06 02 2B 00 00 00 64 39 80
18. systemd Integration, Auto Start, and User Management
To load the gateway automatically at system startup and run it as a service in the background, a your modbus_gateway  
18.5. Restart/Stop  
sudo systemctl restart modbus_gateway  
sudo systemctl stop modbus_gateway  
19. Security and TLS  
19.1. Enable TLS for MQTT  
The connection to the MQTT broker can be encrypted with TLS. Set the following parameters in the INI file:  
[mqtt]  
use_tls = 1  
ca_file = /etc/ssl/certs/ca.crt  
cert_file = /etc/ssl/certs/client.crt  
key_file = /etc/ssl/private/client.key  
insecure = 0  
use_tls = 1 enables TLS  

insecure = 1 disables server certificate verification (not recommended!)  
19.2. Test MQTT over TLS  
If your broker is reachable at mqtts://broker.local:8883, for example:  
broker = ssl://broker.local:8883  
Make sure that the port and protocol (ssl:// instead of tcp://) are correct.  
20. Statistics and Monitoring  
20.1. Automatic Statistics (periodically)  
Every mqttStatsInterval seconds, the following topic is published:  
modbus/stats  
Example content:  
{  
"total_tcp_requests": 1432,  
"total_rtu_requests": no further reconnect thread started.

Successful reconnect leads to the rebuilding of all subscriptions and publication of the online status.  
21.3. Signal Handling  
The following signals are handled:  
SIGINT (e.g., Ctrl+C)

SIGTERM (e.g., via kill)  
These lead to a clean shutdown:  
All client threads are terminated.

MQTT is unsubscribed and the offline status is sent.

Modbus is closed cleanly.

Log file is terminated.  
21.4. TCP Timeout  
Each connected client receives a timeout:  
timeout.tv_sec = 60;  
setsockopt(client_sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO, &timeout, sizeof(timeout));  
setsockopt(client_sock, SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDTIMEO, &timeout, sizeof(timeout));  
Connections without activity will thus be automatically disconnected after 60 seconds.  
22. Logging and Diagnosis  
22.1. Log File  
Default: /var/log/modbus_gateway.log  
Path configurable via INI:  
[log]  
file = /var/log/modbus_gateway.log  
Format:  
YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS - ice  
23.6. MQTT Topics Overview (compact)
